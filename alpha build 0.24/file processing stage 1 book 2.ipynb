      "The worst days were over by then. American soldiers were as numerous as ever— for\n",
      "there was fighting in Korea— but in Nagasaki, after what had gone before, those were\n",
      "days of calm and relief. The world had a feeling of change about it.\n",
      "My husband and I lived in an area to the east of the city, a short tram journey from the\n",
      "centre of town. A river ran near us, and I was once told that before the war a small village\n",
      "had grown up on the riverbank. But then the bomb had fallen and afterwards all that\n",
      "remained were charred ruins. Rebuilding had got under way and in time four concrete\n",
      "buildings had been erected, each containing forty or so separate apartments. Of the four,\n",
      "our block had been built last and it marked the point where the rebuilding programme had\n",
      "come to a halt; between us and the river lay an expanse of wasteground, several acres of\n",
      "dried mud and ditches. Many complained it was a health hazard, and indeed the drainage\n",
      "was appalling. All year round there were craters filled with stagnant water, and in the\n",
      "summer months the mosquitoes became intolerable. From time to time officials were to\n",
      "be seen pacing out measurements or scribbling down notes, but the months went by and\n",
      "nothing was done.\n",
      "The occupants of the apartment blocks were much like ourselves — young married\n",
      "couples, the husbands having found good employment with expanding firms. Many of the\n",
      "apartments were owned by the firms, who rented them to employees at a generous rate.\n",
      "Each apartment was identical; the floors were tatami, the bathrooms and kitchens of a\n",
      "Western design. They were small and rather difficult to keep cool during the warmer\n",
      "months, but on the whole the feeling amongst the occupants seemed one of satisfaction.\n",
      "And yet I remember an unmistakable air of transience there, as if we were all of us\n",
      "waiting for the day we could move to something better.\n",
      "One wooden cottage had survived both the devastation of the war and the government\n",
      "bulldozers. I could see it from our window, standing alone at the end of that expanse of\n",
      "wasteground, practically on the edge of the river. It was the kind of cottage often seen in\n",
      "the 6iiiff is, e,with a tiled roof sloping almost to the ground. Often, during my empty\n",
      "moments, I would stand at my window gazing at it.\n",
      "To judge from the attention attracted by Sachiko's arrival, I was not alone in gazing at\n",
      "that cottage. There was much talk about two men seen working there one day — as to\n",
      "whether or not they were government workers. Later there was talk that a woman and her\n",
      "little girl were living there, and I saw them myself on several occasions, making their\n",
      "way across the ditchy ground.\n",
      " It was towards the beginning of summer — I was in my third or fourth month of\n",
      "pregnancy by then — when I first watched that large American car, white and battered,\n",
      "bumping its way over the wasteground towards the river. It was well into the evening,\n",
      "and the sun setting behind the cottage gleamed a moment against the metal.\n",
      "Then one afternoon I heard two women talking at the tram stop, about the woman who\n",
      "had moved into the derelict house by the river. One was explaining to her companion\n",
      "how she had spoken to the woman that morning and had received a dear snub. Her\n",
      "companion agreed the newcomer seemed unfriendly — proud probably. She must be\n",
      "thirty at the youngest, they thought, for the child was at least ten. The first woman said\n",
      "the stranger had spoken with a Tokyo dialect and certainly was not from Nagasaki. They\n",
      "discussed for a while her \"American friend\", then the woman spoke again of how\n",
      "unfriendly the stranger had been to her that morning.\n",
      "Now I do not doubt that amongst those women I lived with then, there were those who\n",
      "had suffered, those with sad and terrible memories. But to watch them each day, busily\n",
      "involved with their husbands and their children, I found this hard to believe — that their\n",
      "lives had ever held the tragedies and nightmares of wartime. It was never my intention to\n",
      "appear unfriendly, but it was probably true that i made no special effort to seem\n",
      "otherwise, for at that point in my life, I was still wishing to be left alone.\n",
      "It was with interest then that I listened to those women talking of Sachiko. I can recall\n",
      "quite vividly that afternoon at the tram stop. It was one of the first days of bright sunlight\n",
      "after the rainy season in June, and the soaked surfaces of brick and concrete were drying\n",
      "all around us. We were standing on a railway bridge and on one side of the tracks at the\n",
      "foot of the hill could be seen a cluster of roofs, as if houses had come tumbling down the\n",
      "slope.\n",
      "Beyond the houses, a little way off, were our apartment blocks standing like four concrete\n",
      "pillars. I felt a kind of sympathy for Sachiko then, and felt I understood something of that\n",
      "aloof i had noticed about her when I had watched her from afar.\n",
      "We were to become friends that summer and for a short time at least I was to be admitted\n",
      "into her confidence. I am not sure now how it was we first met. I remember one afternoon\n",
      "spotting her figure ahead of me on thd path leading out of the housing precinct. I was\n",
      "hurrying, but Sachiko walked on with a steady stride. By that point we must have already\n",
      "known each other by name, for I remember calling to her as I got nearer.\n",
      "Sachiko turned and waited for me to catch up. \"Is something wrong?\" she asked.\n",
      "\"I'm glad I found you,\" I said, a little out of breath. \"Your daughter, she was fighting just\n",
      "as I came out. Back there near the ditches'\n",
      "\"She was fighting?\"\n",
      "\"With two other children. One of them was a boy. It looked a nasty little fight.\"\n",
      "\"I see.\" Sachiko began to walk again. I fell in step beside her.\n",
      "\"I don't want to alarm you,\" 1 said, \"but it did look quite a nasty fight. In fact, I think I\n",
      "saw a cut on your daughter's cheek.\"\n",
      "\"I see.\"\n",
      "\"It was back there, on the edge of the wasteground.\"\n",
      "\"And are they still fighting, do you think?\" She continued to walk up the hill.\n",
      "\"Well, no. 1 saw your daughter running off.\"\n",
      "Sachiko looked at me and smiled. \"Are you not used to seeing children fight?\"\n",
      "\"Well, children do fight, I suppose. But I thought I ought to tell you. And you see, I don't\n",
      "think she's on her way to school. The other children carried on towards the school, but\n",
      "your daughter went back towards the river.\"\n",
      "Sachiko made no reply and continued to walk up the hill. \"As a matter of fact,\" I\n",
      "continued, \"I'd meant to mention this to you before. You see, I've seen your daughter on\n",
      "a number of occasions recently. I wonder, perhaps, if she hasn't been playing truant a\n",
      "Little.\"\n",
      "The path forked at the top of the bill. Sachiko stopped and we turned to each other.\n",
      "\"It's very kind of you to be so concerned, Etsuko,\" she said. \"So very kind. I'm sure\n",
      "you'll make a splendid mother.\"\n",
      "I had supposed previously — like the women at the tram stop — that Sachiko was a\n",
      "woman of thirty or so. But possibly her youthful figure had been deceiving, for she had\n",
      "the face of an older person. She was gazing at me with a slightly amused expression, and\n",
      "something in the way she did so caused me to laugh self-consciously.\n",
      "\"I do appreciate your coming to find me like this,\" she went on. \"But as you see, I'm\n",
      "rather busy just now. I have to go into Nagasaki.\"\n",
      "\"I see. I just thought it best to come and tell you, that's all.\"\n",
      "for a moment, she continued to look at me with her amused expression. Then she said:\n",
      "\"How kind you are. Now please excuse me. I must get into town.\" She bowed, then\n",
      "turned towards the path that led up towards the tram stop.\n",
      "\"It's just that she had a cut on her face,\" I said, raising my voice a little. \"And the river's\n",
      "quite dangerous in places. I thought it best to come and tell you.\"\n",
      "She turned and looked at me once more. \"If you have nothing else to concern yourself\n",
      "with, Etsuko,\" she said, \"then perhaps you'd care to look after my daughter for the day.\n",
      "I'll be back sometime in the afternoon. I'm sure you'll get on very well with her.\"\n",
      "\"I wouldn't object, if that's what you wish. I must say, your daughter seems quite young\n",
      "to be Left on her own all day.\"\n",
      "\"How kind you are,\" Sachiko said again. Then she smiled once more. \"Yes, I'm sure\n",
      "you'll make a splendid mother.\"\n",
      "After parting with Sachiko, I made my way down the hill and back through the housing\n",
      "precinct. I soon found myself back outside our apartment block, facing that expanse of\n",
      "wasteground. Seeing no sign of the little girl, I was about to go inside, but then caught\n",
      "sight of some movement along the riverbank. Mariko must previously have been\n",
      "crouching down, for now I could see her small figure quite clearly across the muddy\n",
      "ground. At first, I felt the urge to forget the whole matter and return to my housework.\n",
      "Eventually, however, I began making my way towards her, taking care to avoid the\n",
      "ditches.\n",
      "As far as I remember, that was the first occasion I spoke to Mariko. Quite probably there\n",
      "was nothing so unusual about her behaviour that morning, for, after all, I was a stranger\n",
      "to the child and she had every right to regard me with suspicion. And if in fact I did\n",
      "experience a curious feeling of unease at the time, it was probably nothing more than a\n",
      "simple response to Mariko's manner.\n",
      "The river that morning was still quite high and flowing swiftly after the rainy season a\n",
      "few weeks earlier. The ground sloped down steeply before it reached the water's edge,\n",
      "and the mud at the foot of the slope; where the little girl was standing, looked distinctly\n",
      "wetter. Mariko was dressed in a simple cotton dress which ended at her knees, and her\n",
      "short trimmed hair made her face look boyish. She looked up, not smiling, to where I\n",
      "stood at the top of the muddy slope.\n",
      "\"Hello,\" 1 said, \"1 was just speaking with your mother. You must be Mariko-San.\"\n",
      "The little girl continued to stare up at me, saying nothing. What I had thought earlier to\n",
      "be a wound on her cheek, I now saw to be a smudge of mud.\n",
      "\"Shouldn't you be at school?\" I asked.\n",
      "She remained silent for a moment. Then she said: \"I don't 2oto school\"\n",
      "\"Bu tall children must go to school. Don't you like to go?\"\n",
      "\"1 don't go to school.'\n",
      "\"But hasn't your mother sent you to a school here?\"\n",
      "Mariko did not reply. Instead, she took a step away from me.\n",
      "\"Careful,\" I said. \"You'll fall into the water. It's very slippery.\"\n",
      "She continued to stare up at me from the bottom of the slope. I could see her small shoes\n",
      "lying in the mud beside her. Her bare feet, like her shoes, were covered in mud.\n",
      "\"I was just speaking with your mother.\" I said, smiling at her reassuringly. \"She said it\n",
      "would be perfectly all right if you came and waited for her at my house. It's just over\n",
      "there, that building there. You could come and try some cakes I made yesterday. Would\n",
      "you like that, Mariko-San? And you could tell me all about yourself.'\n",
      "Mariko continued to watch me carefully. Then, without taking her eyes off me, she\n",
      "crouched down and picked up her shoes. At first, I took this as a sign that she was about\n",
      "to follow me. But then as she continued to stare up at me, I realized she was holding her\n",
      "shoes in readiness to run away.\n",
      "\"I'm not going to hurt you,\" I said, with a nervous laugh. \"I'm a friend of your mother's.'\n",
      "As far as I remember, that was all that took place between us that morning. I had no wish\n",
      "to alarm the child further, and before long I turned and made my way back across the\n",
      "wasteground. The child's response had, it is true, upset me somewhat; for in those days,\n",
      "such small things were capable of arousing in me every kind of misgiving about\n",
      "motherhood. I told myself the episode was insignificant, and that in any case, further\n",
      "opportunities to make friends with the little girl were bound to present themselves over\n",
      "the coming days. As it was, I did not speak to Mariko again until one afternoon a\n",
      "fortnight or so later.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had never been inside the cottage prior to that afternoon, and I had been rather surprised\n",
      "when Sachiko had asked me in. In fact, I had sensed immediately that she had done so\n",
      "with something in mind, and as it turned out, I was not mistaken.\n",
      "The cottage was tidy, but I remember a kind of stark shabbiness about the place; the\n",
      "wooden beams that crossed the ceiling looked old and insecure, and a faint odour of\n",
      "dampness lingered everywhere. At the front of the cottage, the main partitions had been\n",
      "left wide open to allow the sunlight in across the veranda. For all that, much—of the\n",
      "place remained in shadow.\n",
      "Mariko was lying in the corner furthest from the sunlight. I could see something moving\n",
      "beside her in the shade, and when I came closer, saw a large cat curled up on the tatami.\n",
      "\"Hello, Mariko-San,\" I said. \"Don't you remember me?\"\n",
      "She stopped stroking the cat and looked up.\n",
      "\"We met the other day,\" I went on. \"Don't you remember? You were by the river.'\n",
      "The little girl showed no signs of recognition. She looked at me fora while, then began to\n",
      "stroke her cat again. Behind me. I could hear Sachiko preparing the tea on the open stove\n",
      "at the centre of the mom. I was about to go over to her, when Mariko said suddenly:\n",
      "\"She's going to have kittens.'\n",
      "\"Oh really? How nice.\"\n",
      "\"Do you want a kitten?'\n",
      "\"That's very kind of you, Mariko-San. We'll see. But I'm sure they'll all find nice\n",
      "homes.\"\n",
      "\"Why don't you take a kitten?\" the child said. \"The other woman said she'd take one.'\n",
      "\"We'll see, Mariko-San. Which other lady was this?\"\n",
      "\"The other woman. The woman from across the river. She said she'd take one.\"\n",
      "\"But I don't think anyone lives over there, Mariko-San. It's just trees and forest over\n",
      "there.\"\n",
      "\"She said she'd take me to her house. She lives across the river. I didn't go with her.\"\n",
      "I looked at the child for a second. Then a thought struck me and I laughed.\n",
      "\"But that was me, Mariko-San. Don't you remember? I asked you to come to my house\n",
      "while your mother was away in the town.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mariko looked up at me again. \"Not you,\" she said. \"The other woman. The woman from\n",
      "across the river. She was here last night. While Mother was away.\" - I\n",
      "\"Last night? While your mother was away?' -\n",
      "\"She said she'd take me to her house, but i didn't go with her. Because it was dark. She\n",
      "said we could take the lantern with us\" — she gestured towards a lantern hung on the\n",
      "wall — \"but I didn't go with her. Because it was dark.'\n",
      "Behind me, Sachiko had got to her feet and was looking at her daughter. Mariko became\n",
      "silent, then turned away and began once more to stroke her cat.\n",
      "\"Let's go out on the veranda,' Sachiko said to me. She was holding the tea things on a\n",
      "tray. \"It's cooler out there.\"\n",
      "We did as she suggested, leaving Mariko in her corner. From the veranda, the river itself\n",
      "was hidden from view, but I could see where the ground sloped down and the mud\n",
      "became wetter as it approached the water. Sachiko seated herself on a cushion and began\n",
      "to pour the tea.\n",
      "\"The place is alive with stray cats,\" she said. \"I'm not so optimistic about these kittens.\n",
      "\"Yes, there are so many strays,\" I said. \"It's such a shame. Did Mariko find her cat\n",
      "around here somewhere?\"\n",
      "\"No, we brought that creature with us. I'd have preferred to leave it behind myself, but\n",
      "Mariko wouldn't hear of it.'\n",
      "\"You brought it all the wayftg3o?\"\n",
      "\"Oh no. We've been living in Nagasaki for almost a year now. On the other side of the\n",
      "city.'\n",
      "\"Oh really? I didn't realize that. You lived there with…with friends?\"\n",
      "Sachiko stopped pouring and looked at me, the teapot held in both hands. I saw in her\n",
      "gaze something of that amused expression with which she had observed me on that\n",
      "earlier occasion.\n",
      "\"I'm afraid you're quite wrong, Etsuko,\" she said, eventually. Then she began to pour the\n",
      "tea again. \"We were staying at my uncle's house.\"\n",
      "\"I assure you, I was merely...\"\n",
      "\"Yes, of course. So there's no need to get embarrassed, is there?\" She laughed and passed\n",
      "me my teacup. \"I'm sorry, Etsuko, I don't mean to tease you. As a matter of fact, I did\n",
      "have something to ask you. A little favour.\" Sachiko began to pour tea into her own cup,\n",
      "and as she did so, a more serious air seemed to enter her manner. Then she put down the\n",
      "teapot and looked at me. \"You see, Etsuko, certain arrangements I made have not gone as\n",
      "planned. As a result, I find myself in need of money. Not a great deal, you understand\n",
      "Just a small amount.'\n",
